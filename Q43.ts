//Unchanged Magicians: Start with your work from Exercise 40. Call the function make_great() with a copy of the array of magicians’ names. Because the original array will be unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate array. Call show_magicians() with each array to show that you have one array of the original names and one array with the Great added to each magician’s name.
