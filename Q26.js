/*Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

• Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.*/
// Version 1: Running the if block (Alien's color is green):
// let alienColor = "green";
// if (alienColor === "green") {
//   console.log("Player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.");
// } else {
//   console.log("Player just earned 10 points.");
// };
// Version 2: Running the else block (Alien's color is not green):
// let alienColor = "red"; // You can change the color here
// if (alienColor === "green") {
//   console.log("Player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.");
// } else {
//   console.log("Player just earned 10 points.");
// }
