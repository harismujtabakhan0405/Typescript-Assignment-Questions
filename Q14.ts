//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.


// let dinnerGuests: string[] = ["Haris", "Khan", "Hariq"];


// dinnerGuests.forEach((guest) => {
//     console.log(`Dear ${guest},\nYou are cordially invited to a dinner at my place. Please join us for an evening of great conversation and delicious food.\n\nSincerely, [Your Name]`);
// });
