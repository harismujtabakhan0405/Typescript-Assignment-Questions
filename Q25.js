/*Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)*/
//Version 1 (Passes the if test, and the player earns 5 points because the alien's color is green):
// let alien_color: string = 'green';
// if (alien_color === 'green') {
//   console.log('Congratulations! You just earned 5 points.');
// }
// Version 2 (Fails the if test, and there is no output because the alien's color is not green):
let alien_color = 'red';
if (alien_color === 'green') {
    console.log('Congratulations! You just earned 5 points.');
